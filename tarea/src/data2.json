But their characters are rather different. Prince Bright in the \"Twin Princesses\" starts as a nice guy, but when given powers, the dark feelings in him gain the upper hand, and make him a villain. He acts calm and calculating when he does the bad thing. Hyuu in \"Popolocrois Story\" is not so nice to begin with, and she already has powers, but gets catapulted into another world and situations she is not accustomed to. When she follows her feelings that dwell up in her, she acts rather erratic. I would recommend these titles as studies of child characters in fantasy worlds who deal with the evil inside them.","date":"2024-10-08T16:00:29+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Estefan","username":"Estefan"}},{"mal_id":"50425-50739","entry":[{"mal_id":50425,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/50425\/Fuufu_Ijou_Koibito_Miman","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1713\/126442.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1713\/126442t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1713\/126442l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1713\/126442.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1713\/126442t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1713\/126442l.webp"}},"title":"Fuufu Ijou, Koibito Miman."},{"mal_id":50739,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/50739\/Otonari_no_Tenshi-sama_ni_Itsunomanika_Dame_Ningen_ni_Sareteita_Ken","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1240\/133638.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1240\/133638t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1240\/133638l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1240\/133638.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1240\/133638t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1240\/133638l.webp"}},"title":"Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken"}],"content":"-Both have two characters living alone\/nearly together and taking care of one another -Both relationships offer character growth and show both characters learning to love each other -both characters make moves but have trouble vocalizing how they feel, but both feel the same way. -Heart racing and happy (most times)","date":"2024-10-08T16:00:29+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/MadFwog","username":"MadFwog"}},{"mal_id":"390-57181","entry":[{"mal_id":390,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/390\/Suzuka","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/33579.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/33579t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/33579l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/33579.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/33579t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/9\/33579l.webp"}},"title":"Suzuka"},{"mal_id":57181,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/57181\/Ao_no_Hako","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1341\/145349.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1341\/145349t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1341\/145349l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1341\/145349.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1341\/145349t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1341\/145349l.webp"}},"title":"Ao no Hako"}],"content":"Great school romance build up with characters aiming for achievements in their own sporting category.

Haven't watched the next few seasons of Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei so I don't know if the tone will change but both are very funny.","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Sparklelovesyaa","username":"Sparklelovesyaa"}},{"mal_id":"42897-54856","entry":[{"mal_id":42897,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/42897\/Horimiya","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1695\/111486.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1695\/111486t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1695\/111486l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1695\/111486.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1695\/111486t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1695\/111486l.webp"}},"title":"Horimiya"},{"mal_id":54856,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/54856\/Horimiya__Piece","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1007\/136277.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1007\/136277t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1007\/136277l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1007\/136277.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1007\/136277t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1007\/136277l.webp"}},"title":"Horimiya: Piece"}],"content":"Because its the same anime different season","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Kaito_san11","username":"Kaito_san11"}},{"mal_id":"28851-48926","entry":[{"mal_id":28851,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/28851\/Koe_no_Katachi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1122\/96435l.webp"}},"title":"Koe no Katachi"},{"mal_id":48926,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/48926\/Komi-san_wa_Comyushou_desu","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1899\/117237.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1899\/117237t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1899\/117237l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1899\/117237.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1899\/117237t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1899\/117237l.webp"}},"title":"Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu."}],"content":"Both heroines struggle to communicate and speak to others by writing in a note book","date":"2024-10-05T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/Kaito_san11","username":"Kaito_san11"}},{"mal_id":"40620-55911","entry":[{"mal_id":40620,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/40620\/Uramichi_Oniisan","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1126\/115635.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1126\/115635t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1126\/115635l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1126\/115635.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1126\/115635t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1126\/115635l.webp"}},"title":"Uramichi Oniisan"},{"mal_id":55911,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/55911\/The_Fable","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1254\/141155.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1254\/141155t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1254\/141155l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1254\/141155.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1254\/141155t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1254\/141155l.webp"}},"title":"The Fable"}],"content":"The main characters have an amazing affinity for making sense of reality in silly drawings.

This is because NieR was heavily inspired by it, according to Yoko Taro, the director of NieR Automata, who stated that Nier Automata is \"pretty much just a retelling of Evangelion, so there's not much originality to it.\" Many aspects overlap within both series: Both share similar existential philosophical thoughts focused on what it means to be alive, human identity, human nature, and Existential Crises. Both series heavily revolve around Jungian and Freudian psychoanalysis and psychoanalytic theory regarding relationships, self-reflection, and the challenges the characters face when they confront themselves. Both have branching storylines and are convoluted. Both involve Proxy Wars between opposing forces that are reflections of themselves; in NieR's case, it's about Androids vs. Robots, and for Neon Genesis Evangelion, it's about Humanity vs. Angels. The music is fantastic for both series, focusing on battle-heavy and emotional soundtracks. As vague as that sounds, there are similarities in these music styles and progressions. You would also argue that 9s represents Shinji and 2B represents Rei, and there are overlaps with their character relationships and progressions. As a closing statement: While the anime for NieR isn't as refined as the game it represents, it resembles a lot of Neon Genesis Evangelion, from the mechas and machines to the focus on the wars and conflicts and the open-ended outcomes of both series. If you liked Neon Genesis Evangelion for its mind-boggling ideas and thoughts, then you would like NieR for the same reason.","date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/ChrisDC","username":"ChrisDC"}},{"mal_id":"58059-58173","entry":[{"mal_id":58059,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/58059\/Tsue_to_Tsurugi_no_Wistoria","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1281\/144104.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1281\/144104t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1281\/144104l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1281\/144104.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1281\/144104t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1281\/144104l.webp"}},"title":"Tsue to Tsurugi no Wistoria"},{"mal_id":58173,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/58173\/Mahoutsukai_ni_Narenakatta_Onnanoko_no_Hanashi","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1535\/145026.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1535\/145026t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1535\/145026l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1535\/145026.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1535\/145026t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1535\/145026l.webp"}},"title":"Mahoutsukai ni Narenakatta Onnanoko no Hanashi"}],"content":"Both are set in a magic school where the protagonist struggles with magic.","date":"2024-10-04T00:00:00+00:00","user":{"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/profile\/VenomEmperor","username":"VenomEmperor"}},{"mal_id":"38668-44511","entry":[{"mal_id":38668,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/38668\/Dorohedoro","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1230\/119278.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1230\/119278t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1230\/119278l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1230\/119278.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1230\/119278t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1230\/119278l.webp"}},"title":"Dorohedoro"},{"mal_id":44511,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/44511\/Chainsaw_Man","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1806\/126216.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1806\/126216t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1806\/126216l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1806\/126216.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1806\/126216t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1806\/126216l.webp"}},"title":"Chainsaw Man"}],"content":"Neither series shies away from their vulgar grungy settings - they lean into it and become works of art.

The difference is J-Decker is less focused on being an action series; it is, odd as it may sound, the more cerebral sci-fi show. There is a constant undercurrent of sci-fi in GaoGaiGar that mostly serves to prop up the action. J-Decker takes the same sci-fi as a way to explore characters. Super Robot action results in both cases, but with different sorts of stakes at play. J-Decker is like GaoGaiGar if GaoGaiGar had less Gai and more Mamoru and if it gave the Ryuu-bots more time to develop as characters. In the end it has a lot of the same flavor as GaoGaiGar, but in different
